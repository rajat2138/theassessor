A web application that provide an efficient web based platform for institutions to manage the needs of students. We understand the issues faced in remote places and hence our design is simple yet powerful so that exam can be taken by students even on slower internet connection. Our goal is that each school and students stay connected even when there is no physical appearance. We are in an era of digital reforms and the whole World is online. This is the time we should stand together and collaborate in the making of the future.
